# RationalistRedditBot
A bot to autosubmit content from popular rationalist blogs to reddit.com/r/rationality

Note: If you're running this script outside of the Pacific timezone, you'll need to modify the code slightly as indicated in the comments

TODO: 
- authenticate via Oauth2, instead of with username and password
- make sure that if one of the RSS feeds goes down, the script keeps working for the others
- make it work regardless of time zone
